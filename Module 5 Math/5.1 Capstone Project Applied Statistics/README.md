## About The Project

In this project, I tackled the **"Applied Statistics Interview Grind"** challenge by providing solutions to **50 out of 80** interview questions in a **concise and structured document**.  

The project was evaluated based on several factors, including:
- Content quality
- Problem-solving skills
- Conciseness
- Clarity
- Organization

I ensured that my submission met all the requirements by providing a well-structured document and maintaining proper file organization and naming conventions.
