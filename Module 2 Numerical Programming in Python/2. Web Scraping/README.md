# **Web Scraping & Data Handling Challenge**

## **Project Description**  
This project, assigned by AlmaBetter, involves web scraping, data filtering, and analysis using Python. The goal is to scrape movie and TV show data from [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/in/movies?release_year_from=2000) without directly using their APIs. Using Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas, the data is extracted, cleaned, analyzed, and saved as a CSV file.

## **Key Features**  
### **1. Web Scraping:**  
Scraped detailed information for 50+ movies and TV shows, including:  
- Title  
- Release year  
- Genre  
- IMDb rating  
- Streaming services available (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc.)  
- URL to the JustWatch page  

### **2. Data Filtering & Analysis:**  
- Filtered data to include:  
  - Movies and TV shows from the last 2 years.  
  - IMDb ratings of 7 or higher.  
- Analyzed data to determine:  
  - Average IMDb ratings.  
  - Top 5 most popular genres.  
  - Streaming service with the largest content library.  

### **3. Data Export:**  
- Exported the filtered and analyzed data to a CSV file for further reporting.  

## **Tools & Technologies**  
- **Web Scraping:** BeautifulSoup, Selenium  
- **Data Handling & Analysis:** Pandas  
- **Python Environment:** Google Colab  

## **Submission Details**  
The project includes:  
1. A Python script with clear comments explaining each step.  
2. A shareable Drive link to the CSV dataset.  
3. Robust error handling to ensure the script executes smoothly.
