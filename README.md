    <summary>1. Introduction to Computer Science</summary>
        <p align=center>
        The Introduction to Computer Programming project is designed to evaluate your understanding and practical application of fundamental programming concepts using Python. This assessment encompasses various topics, including data types, indexing, slicing, operators, in-built functions, statements, conditionals, loops, object-oriented programming, and exception handling. In addition, I will showcase my ability to create custom functions and tackle advanced looping concepts.

        <h1 align=center>1. Web Scraping</h1>
        <p align=center>JustWatch is a popular platform that allows users to search for movies and TV shows across multiple streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc. For this assignment, you will be required to scrape movie and TV show data from JustWatch using Selenium, Python, and BeautifulSoup. Extract data from HTML, not by directly calling their APIs. Then, perform data filtering and analysis using Pandas, and finally, save the results to a CSV file.</p><br>
